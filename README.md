# Python OOPs Concepts – Real World Examples

This repository contains my learning journey of Python's Object-Oriented Programming concepts, with clear, real-world-inspired examples for each topic.

1. **Basics** – Classes, Objects, Constructors, Class vs Instance Variables.
2. **Pillars of OOP** – Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.
3. **Advanced Topics** – Magic Methods, Property Decorators, Multiple Inheritance.
4. **Project Ideas** – Small applications that apply OOP concepts.

## 🛠 How to Use
