# OOP Project Ideas

1. **Bank Account Management System** – Deposit, withdraw, check balance.
2. **Library Management System** – Track books, borrowing, returning.
3. **Student Report Card Generator** – Store and compute grades.
4. **Expense Tracker** – Categorize and summarize expenses.
5. **Inventory Tracker** – Add, remove, and search items.

These will be built progressively as I master more OOP concepts.
